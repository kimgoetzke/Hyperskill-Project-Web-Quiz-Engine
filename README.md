In this project, I have developed a multi-users web service for creating and solving quizzes. The service features an API with endpoints for creating users, and adding/requesting/completing/deleting quizzes. Anyone can register but only authorised users can access the other endpoints. The project uses uses Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, and Spring Crypto. For ease of testing, an H2 database is created that can be accessed by the user specified in the security configuration.
